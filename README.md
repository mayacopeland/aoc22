# Advent of Code 2022
Here are my solutions for this year's advent of code. I'd like to explore different languages through this, and may update solutions with different languages eventually.

I'm not playing for the main leaderboard but I am participating in CompSoc's private leaderboard.

[Advent of Code can be found here](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Running
`cargo build` and then run it giving it your COOKIE and then the day in which you want to run like "./target/debug/advent_of_code_2022 <cookie> <day>".

Thank you arty for the code for downloading each days task.
